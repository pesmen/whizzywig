Whizzywig aims to provide the best compromise between small footprint, features and extensibility in a web based HTML editor. It supports all the main formatting features: bold, italics, headings etc. as well image and link insertion and tables.

**Latest version is Whizzy 63**. This includes bug fixes to solve some issues with Chrome and Chromium web browsers, as well problems inserting tables, images and HTML in Internet Explorer 9. It also ensures that table cells always have a border when in the editor, so you can see where the cursor is.
